Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
The tokenizer will take in a string of characters representing a string and return an array of pointers to each individual word. The tokenizer will also maintain a history, so that the user can select from the set of previously input strings to tokenize without having to retype the string.

# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine
