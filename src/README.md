Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
The tokenizer will take in a string of characters and return an array of pointers to each word. The tokenizer will also keep a history, so that the user can choose from previous inputs strings to tokenize without having to retype the string.

### Commands:
**make:** Compiles tokenizer.c and gui.c  
**make clean:** cleans directory from all .o ~ and # files
